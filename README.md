# Vitrae SDK

This is the convenience repository containing VitraeEngine, Showcase, and Documentation submodules.

Each of the modules can be cloned as its own repo, but the SDK is testing and research ready!

# Downloading
After cloning the `VitraeSDK` repo, run commands: 
```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
